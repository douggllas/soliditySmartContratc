        <h1>Decentralized Virtual Medical Prescription System </h1>
        <p> A single center where all health agents and professionals in the area can have access to medical prescriptions or
        relevant data about a particular patient.</p> 
        <img class="imagem" src="My First Board.jpg" alt="">
        
     <p>Based on the initial concepts of Supply Chain, the Decentralized Virtual Medical Prescription system is designed to
        ensure that patient and prescribed medication information is viewed only by accredited agents able to do so if required.
        The system was designed so that information is not accessed randomly without need.</p>

        <h2>Who can access the system?</h2>
        <p>The medical prescription, once generated by the doctor, is available in a safe environment, floating protected and
        waiting for the moment when someone with credentials is authorized to access it.
        This person could be a pharmacist, a nurse or another doctor.</p>
        <h3>The patient can access your own DVP?</h3>
        <p>Yes, he can access it and he is the one who determines the amount of information released to each professional who will
        have contact with the medical prescription.

<h1>What is a Smart Contrat?</h1>
<p>A smart contract is a self-executing contract with embedded rules that defines the agreement and conditions between two or more parties.

Currently, there are more than 30 million smart contracts deployed worldwide spread across industries such as BFSI, energy, life sciences, public sector, and real estate.</p>
