            <h1>Who can access a Smart Contract in a DVP? </h1>
            <p> It is important to remember that the Smart Contract in our case is the structure that will give access
                to the interface
                that will display a prescription. Thus, the prescription has two types of display credentials:
            <ul>
                <li>Visitor</li>
                <li>Owner</li>
            </ul>
            <img class="imagem"
                src="https://images.ctfassets.net/p4n9cqsquyq8/1rdbsWSaVO6ltfzs11YRFv/5c2262c78d632eb4a7acca6bac67b494/What_is_solidity_.png?"
                alt="">

            <h2>Visitor</h2>
            <p>This user has the autonomy to only view what the contract owner allows, since the viewing of some
                information in the
                contract is configured by default, others can be restricted according to the owner's wishes.</p>
            <h2>Owner</h2>
            <p>As soon as the health professional (doctor or respective) generates the contract (prescription) he
                identifies
                in the system database who is the owner of that prescription. This, in turn,
                immediately becomes the owner of the contract and it is he who moderates this Smart Contract from now
                on.
                onwards. As said before, some information displayed on this document can be hidden the next time
                next time the contract is displayed by another health professional, such as pathologies, origin of the
                prescription,
                address
                address, or the patient's name. </p>


            <hr>


            <h1>Storage</h1>
            <p>Once created by a physician, a copy of the document in its original form is stored in a
                secure database (Smart Contract B). Another version of the document (Smart Contract A) is released for
                the
                edits and queries we spoke of earlier by the owner of the document. </p>
            <img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oaFdX.png" alt="">
            <p>
            <h4>Smart Contract B</h4> This version of the document cannot be edited or viewed by the owner, it is
            available only to the owner
            database owner (Ministry of Health or Government agency). That is, even if it is available for
            consultation, the document can only be visualized if the owner has
            interest in doing so.</p>
            <h1>Edição do Smart Contract</h1>
            <p>Once the Smart Contract is created, it must be fed by the healthcare professional who created it, before
                identifying
                the owner. Since once the document has been transferred of ownership, it cannot be fed back.
                Only one
                change can be made to the document: personal data of the owner may or may not be hidden if ele tenha
                want to. </p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Viewing</h2>
            <p>The document can be viewed by three agents: owner, physician who generated the document, or other
                health professional authorized and accredited by the government.
